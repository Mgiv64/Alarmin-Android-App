##Need help or have an idea?
Great, go to the "issues" tab above and submit your idea/issue. However, you need to be registered (free) at GitHub to add any issue. Please check that you don't create any duplicate issues or requests before submitting.

##Translations
If you would like to see the app translated to your language, download the <b>en-GB.txt</b> file and translate the text to the right of the colon (:). Keep the following things in mind when doing translations:
* Keep the translation roughly the same or shorter length (open the app to see where the translation need to fit it)
* All "quotations" must stay so that I can directly import the file into the application
* Take note of capitals in the sentences and try to reproduce them in the translation
* Some text has markers inside, typically enclosed in <>. Please keep these at the same location within the translation, and take note of any spaces before or after them. Markers such as \<b> Alarmin \</b> will bold the word Alarmin, and <br> will create a new line.
* New text is always added at the bottom of the English-UK.txt file. If you are updating an existing language, always check that the latest text is at the bottom. If not, simply copy it over and translate.
